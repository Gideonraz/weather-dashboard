# weather-dashboard
To create this webpage I first created the html file. Then I created the divs for the weather area and the the area where the weather info will populate. Next I added an img tag to add the icons for the weather. Next I went into my js file and added the elements I want to select. Next I added the api key from where the weather data will come from. Next I added the geolocation function to get the weather for your exact location. Next I added a function if there is no geolocation for a browser that does not support that. Next I used fetch to get the weather data from the api provider. Next I used a function to display the weather data to the UI. Then I added a celsius to fahrenheit conversion for anyone who wants to see it in both versions. Next i added an event listener for when the user clicks on the weather and it converts to fahrenheit or celsius. I also used math.floor to do the conversion from C to F.
